## üß± Projects

### üß† Deep Learning üï∏Ô∏è

* [Cart Pole](https://github.com/brkyzdmr/Cart-Pole): Game agent that playing cart pole game using A3C algorithm.
* [A3C-Breakout](https://github.com/brkyzdmr/A3C-Breakout): Game agent that playing breakout game using A3C algorithm.
  * CNN + LSTM architecture
  * Asynchronous train
  * Actor-Critic: Training unsupervised model supervisely.
* [TensorflowPractice](https://github.com/brkyzdmr/TensorflowPractice): 36 Tensorflow applications based on [TensorFlow in Practice Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/tensorflow-in-practice). 
* [DeepLearning](https://github.com/brkyzdmr/Deep-Learning): Jupiter notebooks that covers Deep Learning theory and some tools

### üì∑ Computer Vision üëÅÔ∏è
* [TemplateMatcher](https://github.com/brkyzdmr/TemplateMatcher): Locating the defining area as scale and rotation invariant in the map image and return the coordinates of the matched location.
* [FeatureDetection-Server](https://github.com/brkyzdmr/FeatureDetection-Server): Feature matching based navigation application on images. 
  * It is a solution created in the context of image processing against the problem of locating and navigating due to the fact that the global position system cannot be used under certain extreme conditions.
  * Basically, it calculates feature vector using SIFT algorithm in navigation images, then it finds the proximity of the images in the feature space using K-Nearest Neighbour algorithm.
  * With this approach, we can find a spesific image's location if it's inside the data set.
  * This project created within the scope of my undergraduate thesis.
  * **Accomplishment:** By reducing the vector space with PCA, I achieved a speed increase of about 100 times without decreasing the performance rate.
* [OpenCVImageMatching](https://github.com/brkyzdmr/OpenCV-ImageMatching): Scale and rotation invariant feature based location detector.

### üìÑ Data Science üí°
* [TermDepositMarketingDataAnalysis](https://github.com/brkyzdmr/TermDepositMarketingDataAnalysis): Data analysis for predicting if the customer will subscribe to a term deposit.
* [CourseraIBMCapstone](https://github.com/brkyzdmr/Coursera_Capstone): This venture intends to choose the most secure neighborhood in London dependent on the all out violations, investigate the areas of that district to locate the 10 most regular settings in every area lastly group the areas utilizing k-means clustering.
* [AnomalyDetection](https://github.com/brkyzdmr/AnomalyDetection): Comparing anomaly detection algorithms for keystroke dynamics.

### üíª Software Development üßÆ
* [WikipediaInvertedIndex](https://github.com/brkyzdmr/WikipediaInvertedIndex): Inverting Wikipedia indexes using Java and Hadoop
* [PointRegionQuadTree](https://github.com/brkyzdmr/PointRegionQuadTree): Point region quad tree Java implementation
* [MapTrajectory](https://github.com/brkyzdmr/MapTrajectory): Multithreaded map trajectory data processing server and client service.
  * In this project, it is possible to send the trajectory data, which is taken as a text document by the help of an interface in the client side, to the server side and allows various reduction operations. 
  *  The server visualizes trajectory data using the Google API and returns the result to the user after performing the reduction by using the Ramer-Douglas-Peucker algorithm.
  *  Multithreaded architecture supports more than one client.
*  [SearchEngine](https://github.com/brkyzdmr/SearchEngine): Basic page ranking based search engine demo in Python
