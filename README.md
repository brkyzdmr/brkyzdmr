## üß± Projects

### üß† Deep Learning üï∏Ô∏è

* [A3C-Breakout](https://github.com/brkyzdmr/A3C-Breakout): Game agent that playing breakout game using A3C algorithm.
  * CNN + LSTM architecture
  * Asynchronous train
  * Actor-Critic: Training unsupervised model supervisely.
* [TensorflowPractice](https://github.com/brkyzdmr/TensorflowPractice): 36 Tensorflow applications based on [TensorFlow in Practice Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/tensorflow-in-practice). 

### üì∑ Computer Vision üëÅÔ∏è
* [TemplateMatcher](https://github.com/brkyzdmr/TemplateMatcher): Locating the defining area as scale and rotation invariant in the map image and return the coordinates of the matched location.
* [FeatureDetection-Server](https://github.com/brkyzdmr/FeatureDetection-Server): Feature matching based navigation application on images. 
  * It is a solution created in the context of image processing against the problem of locating and navigating due to the fact that the global position system cannot be used under certain extreme conditions.
  * Basically, it calculates feature vector using SIFT algorithm in navigation images, then it finds the proximity of the images in the feature space using K-Nearest Neighbour algorithm.
  * With this approach, we can find a spesific image's location if it's inside the data set.
  * This project created within the scope of my undergraduate thesis.
  * **Accomplishment:** By reducing the vector space with PCA, I achieved a speed increase of about 100 times without decreasing the performance rate.
* [OpenCVImageMatching](https://github.com/brkyzdmr/OpenCV-ImageMatching): Scale and rotation invariant feature based location detector.

### üìÑ Data Science üí°
* [TermDepositMarketingDataAnalysis](https://github.com/brkyzdmr/TermDepositMarketingDataAnalysis): Data analysis for predicting if the customer will subscribe to a term deposit.

### üíª Software Development üßÆ
* [PointRegionQuadTree](https://github.com/brkyzdmr/PointRegionQuadTree): Point region quad tree Java implementation
* [MapTrajectory](https://github.com/brkyzdmr/MapTrajectory): Multithreaded map trajectory data processing server and client service.
  * In this project, it is possible to send the trajectory data, which is taken as a text document by the help of an interface in the client side, to the server side and allows various reduction operations. 
  *  The server visualizes trajectory data using the Google API and returns the result to the user after performing the reduction by using the Ramer-Douglas-Peucker algorithm.
  *  Multithreaded architecture supports more than one client.
*  [SearchEngine](https://github.com/brkyzdmr/SearchEngine): Basic page ranking based search engine demo in Python
*  [ImageEditor](https://github.com/brkyzdmr/ImageEditor): Basic image editing software that can transform/crop etc. images in pixel level using C#.
*  [SudokuSolver](https://github.com/brkyzdmr/SudokuSolver): Sudoku solver using stochastic search paradigm in C#.
* [TravellingSalesman](https://github.com/brkyzdmr/DijkstraMapProLab2-1): Solving travelling salesman problem using Dijkstra algorithm in C and Windows API. Full featured GUI is available.
* [TextEditor](https://github.com/brkyzdmr/texteditor_v1.0): Console based text editor that can operate binary-level various string operation in C.
* [3DPrinter](https://github.com/brkyzdmr/3DPrinter): Custom boot screen configuration for Marlin based Tevo Tarantula 3D printer.
* [Laside](https://github.com/brkyzdmr/Laside): Comprehensive word saving application in Python. I create this project for saving words that I learn easily and effectively.

### üéÆ Game Development üïπÔ∏è
*  [FlappyBird](https://github.com/brkyzdmr/FlappyBird): Flappy Bird clone in Java using LibGDX library.
*  [indieyogurt](https://twitter.com/indieyogurt): Mobile game company
